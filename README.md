## Abstract

Recently, reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDHEI) has received widespread attention from researchers. To embed high payload into encrypted images while maintaining sufficient security, a novel RDHEI algorithm in combination with consecutive zero-valued high bit-planes compression, bitplane swapping as well as block rearrangement is proposed in this paper. The proposed method is the first work to compress global zero-valued high bit-planes in a block-wise manner and adaptively allocate different Huffman indicators based on the occurrence frequency of zero-valued bit-planes so that a higher embedded payload is greatly provided. Unlike existing RDHEI methods embedded with unencrypted auxiliary information, resulting in low security, the bit-plane swapping and block rearrangement are subtly designed to cluster together all embeddable bit-planes, which enables most auxiliary information to be encrypted, largely enhancing the security and facilitating data embedding and data extraction. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms some stateof-the-art RDHEI methods in terms of security and payload. The average payload of the proposed method for two publicly-used datasets including BOSSbase and BOWS-2, are 3.793 bpp and 3.705 bpp, respectively.
